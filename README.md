# 7in-1-Sensor-Test-codes
This is source codes to test 7in 1 soil sensor

Description
Soil EC water temperature PH nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium seven-in-one sensor is suitable for measuring soil temperature, moisture, total salt content (conductivity), soil PH, and nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. This Soil 7-in-1 sensors creatively measure conductivity, moisture, temperature, ph, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium parameters together, greatly facilitating the customer system to assess the soil situation. Compared with the original high precision sensor in Germany and the actual drying weighing method of soil, the sensor has high precision, fast response and stable output: it is less affected by the salt content of soil and is suitable for all kinds of soil quality. Can be buried in the soil for along time, resistance to long-term electrolysis, corrosion resistance, vacuum filling, completely waterproof.
